## Steps To Run Locally

After cloning the repo, you will need :

- A .env file: It has to contain **at least** the DB_URI key as the MongoDB URI, optionally PORT can be set (default is 3000)

- Run: `npm install` (this will create the node_modules folder)
- Run: `npm run start`(to run the server)
- Run: `npm run test`(to run the tests)
